### Potato Classification End to End Project
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying potato leaf diseases using the PlantVillage dataset available on Kaggle.

#### Project Overview
Objective: The goal is to train a deep learning model that can accurately identify these three potato leaf conditions based on provided images.

Dataset: We will be using the potato class from the popular PlantVillage dataset on Kaggle. This dataset contains images of potato leaves categorized into three classes: healthy, early blight, and late blight.

Potential Applications: This project can be a stepping stone for building a real-world application for farmers to diagnose potato leaf diseases in their fields using mobile phones or other image capturing devices. Early detection of diseases can help farmers take timely actions to minimize crop loss.
